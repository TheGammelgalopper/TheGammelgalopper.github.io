Mechanical Engineer who is interested in all sorts of stuff!
Mostly Server Hardware and sophisticated "home" networks. (It's only fun, when it screams at you!)

### More Information

Born right before the turn of the millenium in Germany. I love technology, photography, sailing and many more things. I am by no means an expert when it comes to system administration, coding or anything else computer related, but I always give my very best to explain topics in simple terms and try to make technology easier to use for everyone!
